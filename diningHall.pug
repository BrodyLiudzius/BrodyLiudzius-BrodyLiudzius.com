				p    This page will show todays menu for each dining hall at 
					| CSULB. It is meant to be faster and easier to use than the 
					a(href="https://www.csulb.edu/49er-shops-at-the-beach/residential-dining-menu-cycles") school website
					| . The menus shown below are based off of what is posted
					| on the school website which is not always 100% accurate to
					| what is actually being served in the dining halls
					| (but it should be close).
