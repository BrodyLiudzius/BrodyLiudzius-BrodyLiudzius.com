# My Personal Website

This repository houses the source for my personal website, [brodyliudzius.com](http://www.brodyliudzius.com). The website is made from scratch using [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)—a templating language that compiles to html—,CSS, and Javascript. The website will contain information about me, my resumé, notes, and a blog.

It is currently in its early stages and will will be added to as frequently as possible. I work on this when I have time between and around my class schedule.
