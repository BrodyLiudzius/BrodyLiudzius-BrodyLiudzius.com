          <h1>About Me (and my website)</h1>
          <p>
               My name is Brody Liudzius and I am currently a third-year computer engineering student studying at California State
            University, Long Beach. I transferred here in Fall of 2022
            from Moorpark College after getting my Associate's
            degree. I'm currently slated to graduate in spring of
            2025.
          </p>
          <p>
               My interest in computer engineering started in high school when my friends and I took a game design class together. It was there
            that I learned how to program and at home I began to experiment
            with electronic circuits. I've always enjoyed science, engineering,
            and art and I am always starting personal projects of all sorts.
          </p>
          <p>
               This website was started in college—primarily as a place for me to post whatever I'm up to as well as my notes, but also to serve as a
            portfolio of sorts. To that end, you can find my LinkedIn, GitHub, and resumé
            linked below. I am <strong>not</strong> a web developer and web development is far
            from my area of expertise, but I try to learn a little of everything
            and a website is an easy thing to point people towards.
          </p>
          <p>
               If you want to know more about the website and how it works, then here's the run-down: This website is written from scratch using <a href="https://github.com/pugjs/pug">Pug</a> (a templating language that compiles to HTML) and CSS. The source
            for this website can be found on <a href="https://github.com/BrodyLiudzius">my GitHub</a>. I <i>do not</i> recommend building a website from scratch, but it
            makes the website small and fast and more importantly, gave me
            some hands-on learning experience with HTML and CSS. I am currently
            self-hosting this website from <a href="https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu4-special-price/">a very small computer</a> because I'm a college student with no money.
